# iOS Programming Final
### Final Project

Final Project for CSCI-UA.0480-​002 - iOS Programming

“Collector Car infoNet,” allows users to access a database of collector car auctions from Mecum Auctions—a car auction company from Wisconsin.


This summer I completed work on the project, and successfully launched “Carval” to the App
Store. Available for free.
